This is my portofolio website, it's still on progress because I still have so much work to do on the javascript to add more functionality. I plan to fix the mobile version to make my contents look bigger and adding more animation with CSS since the design still looks too plain. 
I'm also still deciding whether to use the scroll or nav button in javascript for the slideshow to view each of my ".all" pseudo-class.
