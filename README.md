This is my portofolio website, it's still on progress as I still have so much work to do on the javascript to add more functionality. I plan to add more animation with CSS since it's still too plain to look at. 
I'm still deciding whether to use the scroll or nav button on javascript for the slideshow for each of my ".all" class.
